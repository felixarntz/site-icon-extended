Site Icon Extended
==================

This plugin enhances the WordPress Site Icon feature by adding more icon formats for improved cross-browser compatibility.

**Features:**

* adds more icon sizes for the default icon and Apple Touch Icon to better support different resolutions
* generates an `.ico` file to use for the general shortcut icon
* generates a `browserconfig.xml` file to support Windows 8.1
* allows upload and color specification of an SVG image to use as Pinned Tab Icon for Safari
* adds a Customizer field to specify an icon background color used by some Windows devices 

You can download the latest version from the [WordPress plugin repository](http://wordpress.org/plugins/site-icon-extended/). If you prefer to install it from Github, make sure to run `composer install` before using it in order to download the necessary dependencies.
